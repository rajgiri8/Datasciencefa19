    "1. First i used the counter library from python and counted each frequencies of words in email body and ploted the words with spam vs ham to see the distribution, going through those frequencies i picked the most occurance of 15 words to use as feature in the model with the help of counter library. The accuracy got to around 86%,  after that to tune it further i noticed from previous plot on the distribution of ham/spam email length and used that feature as well as spam email length often tends to be slightly longer than the ham email from the distribution and i was able to get the accuracy of 89%. Adding more to it, i submitted it to kaggle and got accuracy of 88.6 % but everyone had higher score and i came back to the model and exploited the python counter function further more. I sorted the word frequencies and ficked the 407 feature and train the model on iteration using from just one feature to all the feature that i randomly selected to see how acruacy changed. I noticed the more feature i was using the more accuracy changed and i picked the set of feature where it gave least amount of false negative where no very less number of ham email are classified as spam. Since i was using regularization i knew the model won't overfitt so again i ran the model on test data and submitted it to kaggle and now have an accuracy of 99%.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I tried looking at the distribution of words in spam email and picked the most words that are common in spam email and it worked, i tried regularization logistic regression which also worked and at the end to get to the required accuracy i tried the length of the email body as a feature which worked. Among many things that worked, previously i picked few words and ran logistic regression. It was giving me 84-85% accuracy but as i added more words to get to higher accuracy, the model seem to overfit and accuracy started dropping and than i switched to regularization logistic regression and it worked amazingly and the more words/feature i added, the accuracy improved as regularization avoided my model from overfitting. I also tried using number of occurance of characters like ! and $ but the accuracy didn't changed so i ended up not using it. Comming back to this question now since i added almost 401 feature after first submission, now the model accuracy increased a lot than before. adding more feature worked well and actually improved precision,recall and false alarm rate as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. While doing this assignment, i created two model to compare how the model differentiate. One was normal Logistic Regression and one with Regularization. The surprising thing i found out was when i added more feature in normal logistic regression the accuracy started dropping and also it was performing poor in validation data but when i switched to regularization logistic regression i was able to add more feature as i think was appropriate and was able to increase the accuracy and also there was not much difference in result from training set vs validation set. I also noticed that the length of email worked really well even without changin the scale of measurement becase the length was in thousands. This was a really fun exercise and i learned that how encoding occurance of each words and creating a design matrix, we were able to predict if a email is spam or not using logistic regression. This is amazing how even using 407 feature, the model did quite great on test data, i am eager to see how well is it gona perform on the hidden test data."

    "### Question 9: ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases we won't be able to get no false positives and no false negatives, so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, plot an ROC curve for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle). Refer to the Lecture 22 notebook or Section 17.7 of the course text to see how to plot an ROC curve.\n",
